# Project Title

In this project, we investigate a gene expression dataset for patients with bladder cancer. Our data was acquired from the National Center for Biotechnology Information <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE31684>. It consists of microarray data from 93 bladder cancer patients. Our goal in this project is to investigate the correlation between gene expression and metastasis occurrence. We are also interested in assessing the relevance of smoking when looking at metastasis, and we looked at the regulation of the genes of this population when it comes to metastasis.
